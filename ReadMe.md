# Video Game DB 2022 API Automation Framework Documentation

---

## Overview

This documentation provides a detailed guide to set up, run, and view test reports for the API automation framework that uses **Java**, **TestNG**, **RestAssured**, and **ExtentReports**. The framework is designed to test APIs for the **Video Games API** by automating API requests, validating responses, and generating detailed reports.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before setting up the framework, ensure you have the following tools and software installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher)**  
  [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

- **Apache Maven (for dependency management)**  
  [Download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

- **IDE**: You can use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other IDE that supports Maven projects.  
  [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)  
  [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/)

- **Git**: To clone the repository or push changes.  
  [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## 2. Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Project Repository

Clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

### Step 2: Open the Project in an IDE

1. Open **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse**.
2. Choose **Open Project** and navigate to the folder where the project was cloned.
3. Maven should automatically detect the `pom.xml` file and download the necessary dependencies. If it doesn’t, right-click on the project and select `Maven -> Reload Project`.

### Step 3: Review the Project Structure

The project should have the following structure:

```
├── src
│   ├── main
│   └── test
│       ├── java
│       │   ├── apiTests (Contains the test cases)
│       │   ├── utils (For utility methods)
│       └── resources
│           └── config.properties (Contains the API endpoints and other configurations)
├── pom.xml (Contains all the dependencies)
└── test-output (The folder where the ExtentReports HTML will be generated)
```

---

## 3. Configuring the API Endpoints

The API endpoints, headers, or other configuration details are stored in a `config.properties` file inside the `resources` folder. You can modify this file based on the environment you're testing (e.g., staging, production).

### Sample `config.properties` file:

```properties
# API Endpoints
base_url=https://www.videogamedb.uk
auth_endpoint=/authenticate
games_endpoint=/videogames
```

If you need to change any endpoint or base URL, update the values in this file.

---

## 4. Running the Tests

You can run the tests using the following methods:

### Option 1: Running from the IDE

1. Right-click on the `testng.xml` file located in the root of your project.
2. Select **Run As > TestNG Suite**.

   This will execute all test cases defined in the `testng.xml` suite, and the reports will be generated automatically.

### Option 2: Running from the Command Line

To run the tests using Maven, open a terminal in the project’s root directory and use the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```

This will execute the test cases and generate the ExtentReports HTML file.

---

## 5. Viewing Test Reports

Once the test execution is complete, the test results will be available in a detailed HTML report generated by **ExtentReports**. The report provides a comprehensive summary of each test, including pass/fail statuses, logs, and error details (if any).

### Location of Reports:

The ExtentReports HTML file will be generated in the `test-output` directory:

```
test-output/ExtentReport.html
```

### Steps to View the Report:

1. After running the tests, navigate to the `test-output` directory.
2. Open the `ExtentReport.html` file in any browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3. The report will display:
   - **Dashboard**: Overview of total tests, passed/failed tests, and test execution times.
   - **Test Details**: Detailed results of each test, including logs and status for each test case.
   - **Error Logs**: In case of failures, you will see a stack trace of the error for debugging.

---

## 6. Continuous Integration (Optional)

If you want to integrate this framework into a **CI/CD pipeline** using tools like **GitHub Actions**, **Jenkins**, or **GitLab CI**, follow these steps:

1. **Set up CI Pipeline**:  
   Create a CI pipeline configuration (e.g., `.yml` file for GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) that runs the `mvn test` command on each commit or pull request.

2. **Artifacts and Reports**:  
   Configure the CI tool to save the `test-output/ExtentReport.html` as an artifact, which can be viewed after the test execution is complete.

---

## 7. Extending the Framework

This framework can be easily extended to include more API endpoints and more detailed test cases. Here are some ideas for extension:

- **Additional API Test Cases**: Add more test cases for other API endpoints like creating, updating, or deleting video games.
- **Parameterization**: Use TestNG’s `@DataProvider` to parameterize test cases for different input data.
- **External Data Source**: You can use an Excel or CSV file to store test data, and read it in your test cases.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Set up automatic test runs on every commit with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or any CI tool of your choice.

## 8. Conclusion

This API automation framework provides a flexible and scalable way to automate testing of REST APIs using Java, TestNG, RestAssured, and ExtentReports. By following the steps above, you should be able to set up, run tests, and generate detailed reports effortlessly.

If you encounter any issues or have additional questions, feel free to refer to the project's README or reach out for support.
