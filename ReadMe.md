# Video Game DB 2022 API Automation Framework Documentation

---

## Overview

This documentation provides a detailed guide to set up, run, and view test reports for the API automation framework that uses **Java**, **TestNG**, **RestAssured**, and **ExtentReports**. The framework is designed to test APIs for the **Video Game DB 2022 API** by automating API requests, validating responses, and generating detailed reports using **ExtentReports**.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before setting up the framework, ensure you have the following tools and software installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher)**  
  [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

- **Apache Maven (for dependency management)**  
  [Download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

- **IDE**: You can use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other IDE that supports Maven projects.  
  [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)  
  [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/)

- **Git**: To clone the repository or push changes.  
  [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## 2. Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Project Repository

Clone the framework to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kodcapsule/VideoGameDB-API-Test-Framework.git
```

### Step 2: Open the Project in an IDE

1. Open **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse**.
2. Choose **Open Project** and navigate to the folder where the project was cloned.
3. Maven should automatically detect the `pom.xml` file and download the necessary dependencies. If it doesn’t, right-click on the project and select `Maven -> Reload Project`.

### Step 3: Review the Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
├── src
│   ├── main
│   └── test
│       ├── java
│       │   ├── api.endpoints
│       │   ├── api.payload
│       │   ├── api.test
│       │   ├── api.utilities
│       └── resources
│           └── config.properties
├── pom.xml
└── reports
```

---

## 3. Configuring the API Endpoints

The API endpoints, headers, or other configuration details are stored in a `config.properties` file inside the `resources` folder.

### `config.properties` file:

```properties

# Base URL
base.url=https://www.videogamedb.uk:443/api/



# Endpoints
auth.controller.endpoint=https://www.videogamedb.uk:443/api/authenticate
games.controller.endpoint=https://www.videogamedb.uk:443/api/videogame
games2.controller.endpoint=https://www.videogamedb.uk:443/api/videogame/{id}


# V2 endpoints
games.controller-v-2.endpoint=https://www.videogamedb.uk:443/api/v2/videogame
games.controller-v-2.endpointId=https://www.videogamedb.uk:443/api/v2/videogame/{id}

```

If you need to change any endpoint or base URL, update the values in this file.

## 4. Running the Tests

You can run the tests using the following methods:

### Option 1: Running from the IDE

1. Right-click on the `testng.xml` file located in the root of your project.
2. Select **Run As > TestNG Suite**.

   This will execute all test cases defined in the `testng.xml` suite, and the reports will be generated automatically.

### Option 2: Running from the Command Line

To run the tests using Maven, open a terminal in the project’s root directory and use the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```

This will execute the test cases and generate the ExtentReports HTML file.

---

## 5. Viewing Test Reports

Once the test execution is completed, the test results will be available in a detailed HTML report generated by **ExtentReports**. The report provides a comprehensive summary of each test, including pass/fail statuses, logs, and error details.

### Location of Reports:

The ExtentReports HTML file will be generated in the `reports` directory:

```
reports/Test-Report-yyyy.MM.dd.HH.mm.ss.html
```

### Steps to View the Report:

1. After running the tests, navigate to the `reports` directory.
2. Open the `Test-Report-yyyy.MM.dd.HH.mm.ss.html` file in any browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3. The report will display:
   - **Dashboard**: Overview of total tests, passed/failed tests, and test execution times.
   - **Test Details**: Detailed results of each test, including logs and status for each test case.
   - **Error Logs**: In case of failures, you will see a stack trace of the error for debugging.

## 6. Extending the Framework

This framework can be easily extended to include more API endpoints and more detailed test cases. Here are some ideas for extension:

- **Additional API Test Cases**: Add more test cases for other API endpoints like creating, updating, or deleting video games.
- **Parameterization**: Use TestNG’s `@DataProvider` to parameterize test cases for different input data.
- **External Data Source**: You can use an Excel or CSV file to store test data, and read it in your test cases.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Set up automatic test runs on every commit with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or any CI tool of your choice.

## 7. Helpful Commands

Here’s a summary of key commands you might use:

- **Run tests via Maven**:

  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```

- **Clean the project**:

  ```bash
  mvn clean
  ```

- **Rebuild and run tests**:
  ```bash
  mvn clean test
  ```
